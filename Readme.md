# Twig

# Install
    We need to install next packages and python version:
    * unittest 
    * Python 3.7
# Coding
   I developed two different ways, both solutions are the same complexity :
    1.  The first solution is more Python style using the range function and using an index for split array in different chunks.
    2.  is a more iterative format. I'm read the array mintwhile the length of the array is less than the N.
   I created a specific function to check al precondition and decouple the logic of the split algorithm
